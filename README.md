# Credit-Card-Default-Classification
From a study of the Federal Trade Commission, credit card fraud has dramatically increased. From 2019 to 2020 itself, credit card fraud increased by almost 45%, which is a severe problem. By solving this problem, we can reduce banks and users loss and thereafter increase their profit. Machine learning techniques could provide a lot of help in the following ways:
Prevent suspicious transactions,
Save money for customers and banks,
Higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.
In this project, we dealt with two main questions. 
1. What kind of transactions are more likely to be fraudulent?
2. What can banks do to prevent fraudulent transactions in the future? 
By addressing these two questions, we can help banks and people to avoid credit card fraud.
